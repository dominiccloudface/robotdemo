# robotdemo

I enjoyed the demo and used Protocols and a TDD approach

However just as I was finishing I realised the the map coords are only providfe on the first script, where as I thought every script had them.
As this would have required refactoring the command funcs into another class and I had already spent over 3 hours I altereded the input scripts to match.
        
The other caveat is that my offScreen doesn't seem to work, I think my understanding of 2D Swift Arrays is at fault here as the code logic looks good to me.
I am only checking for the scent and setting scent on the current position before movement has accured so again no time to check further.

But I hope the techniques used and logic behind thinking and TDD approach shows relevant skills requifred for a Sky Sports App :)
